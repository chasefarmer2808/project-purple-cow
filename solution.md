# Project Purple Cow

## Configure Port
The port number that CRA will use is stored in the `.env` file with the name `PORT`.  This
can be changed to any valid, open port number on the server.  CRA will use the latest value
automatically.
## Notes
- Button will fetch latest hit count every time it's pressed.
- Figure out how to configure serving port for CRA.
### Extra Credit Focus Points
1. Nice styling (mobile friendly)
2. Accessability (button label, proper html tags)
3. Unit test for the hit count rendering.
### Future Updates
- Show current hit count in real time.  Polling, websocket, or real-time DB.
